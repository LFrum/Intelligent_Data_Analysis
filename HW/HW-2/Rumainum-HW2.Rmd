# PROBLEM 1
# Problem 1a
# 3.2.4 Exercise #4
# create a scatter plot from mpg data sets of hwy vs cyl
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cyl, y = hwy))
# 3.2.4 Exercise #5
# create a scatter plot from mpg data sets of class vs drv
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = class))

# The plot is not useful because it only gives information about the type of car and whether it uses front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive, or four-wheel drive and nothing about its fuel economy.

# 3.3.1 Exercise #3
# create a plot of hwy vs displ and map it with a continuous variable, year for color aesthetic
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = year))

# In case of color aesthetic, categorical vs. continous variables would work either way where categorical variables will create range of distinct colors, such as, red, blue, green, etc. while the continuous variables will create a range of continuous shade of a specific color, such as, different shade of the color blue.

# create a plot of hwy vs displ and map it with a categorical variable, class for color aesthetic
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))

# create a plot of hwy vs displ and map it with a continuous variable, year for size aesthetic
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = year))

# In case of size aesthetic, the use of a discrete (categorical) variables are not advised because size is an ordered aesthetic and a categorical variable is an unordered variable.

# create a plot of hwy vs displ and map it with a categorical variable, class for size aesthetic
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class))

# create a plot of hwy vs displ and map it with a continuous variable, year for shape aesthetic
# Note: next code is commentted out on purpose because continouse variable cannot be used for shape aesthetic
#ggplot(data = mpg) + 
#  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = year))

# In case of shape aesthetic, continuous variable cannot be used. R will throw an error message "Error: A continuous variable can not be mapped to shape". Shape aesthetic can only mapped with categorical variables.

# create a plot of hwy vs displ and map it with a categorical variable, drive for shape aesthetic
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = drv))

# 3.3.1 Exercise #4
# create a plot of hwy vs displ and map it with a discrete variable, drv for color and shape aesthetic
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv, shape = drv))

# If you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics, ggplot will automatically chose a scale for the different values of that variable and constructs a legend for them to explain the mapping of it.


# 3.3.1 Exercise #6
# create a plot of hwy vs cyl and map it with a continuous variable, disp for color aesthetic
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cyl, y = hwy, color = displ < 5))

# As plotted, ggplot create a legend that shows two different values (TRUE and FALSE) for the color scale which indicate if the engine displacement is less than five litres (blue) or if it is five litres and above (red).


# 3.5.1 Exercise #4
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)

# The advantages to using faceting instead of the color aesthetic are that with faceting you will be able to see more clearly the data for each different subset since clustered data can be divided into several subsets data, and you can analysis an even closer relationship between variables using facet_grid() if needed to be. 
# The disadvateges to using faceting instead of the color aesthetic are you will need an extra step to see how close are the values between each different class and whether they do overlap as a whole.
# The balance might change with a larger dataset because having only two rows of plots will probably less effective than having ten rows x ten columns subsets plot or the more symmetric and/or easy to read subsets plot (depending on the data that is presented).


# Problem 1b
# create linear model for hwy vs displ to use to create the fitted line
linModel <- lm(data=mpg, hwy~displ) 
#We estimate a mixed model using lmer() from the lme4 package, with a fixed effect of
#displ, and random intercepts and coefficients for displ by drv
mixed <- lmer(hwy ~ displ + (1+displ|drv), data=mpg) 
#fitted values from the mixed model
mpg$fit_mix <- predict(mixed)

# plot according to figure 1
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + # use data from mpg dataset with mapping from displ and hwy variables
  geom_point(aes(jitter(mpg$displ,0.5), jitter(mpg$hwy,2)), alpha = 0.1) + #add jitters to x and y values and alpa aesthetic
  geom_smooth(method ="loess") + # create the smoothed plot using loess method
  geom_line(aes(y = fit_mix), size = 1) + # create the fitted line with size of 1
  xlab("Displacement") + # x-label
  ylab("Highway MPG") + # y-label
  facet_wrap(~drv) # facet wrap by drv variable

# Problem 4
# load freetrade data from Amelia package
data ("freetrade",package = "Amelia") 

# get the overall information that is missing on freetrade data frame using VIM's aggr function
missingInfo <- aggr(freetrade)
summary(missingInfo) # summary of missing information for each variables

# scattmatrixMiss that shows the correlations of all variables in freetrade data frame
scattmatrixMiss(freetrade)


# from summary, we know that there are missing data from tariff, gdp.pc, intresmi, signed, and gdp.pc variables
# so, now, we look at scattmatrixMiss plot for the year and country against each of those variable
scattmatrixMiss(data.frame(freetrade$year, freetrade$country, freetrade$tariff))
scattmatrixMiss(data.frame(freetrade$year, freetrade$country, freetrade$gdp.pc))
scattmatrixMiss(data.frame(freetrade$year, freetrade$country, freetrade$intresmi))
scattmatrixMiss(data.frame(freetrade$year, freetrade$country, freetrade$signed))
scattmatrixMiss(data.frame(freetrade$year, freetrade$country, freetrade$gdp.pc))

# we can also use the marginplot to see the relationship between two variables from freetrade data frame, such as, below:
marginplot(freetrade[c("year","gdp.pc")], col = c("blue", "red", "orange")) # relation between year and gdp.pc values
marginplot(freetrade[c("year","intresmi")], col = c("blue", "red", "orange")) # relation between year and intresmi values

# Problem 4b
# create country and tariff variables
country <- freetrade$country
tariff <- freetrade$tariff

chisq.test(country, tariff) # do chi-square test

# Exclude Nepal from the freetrade data 
freetrade.woNepal <- freetrade[!(freetrade$country == "Nepal"),]
# update country and tariff variables
country <- freetrade.woNepal$country
tariff <- freetrade.woNepal$tariff

chisq.test(country, tariff) # do chi-square test

# Exclude Philippines from the freetrade data 
freetrade.woPhilippines <- freetrade[!(freetrade$country == "Philippines"),]
# update country, and tariff variables
country <- freetrade.woPhilippines$country
tariff <- freetrade.woPhilippines$tariff

chisq.test(country, tariff) # do chi-square test

# From the test, you can see that tariff is independent with the country variable. If you obsevered each chi-square test, they are not related and it also shows from the p-value that is less than the significance level alpha of 0.05. Excluding Nepal or Philippines changes the p-value of the chi-square test because Nepal have significant numbers of missing tariff while Philippines have all their tariff values.
